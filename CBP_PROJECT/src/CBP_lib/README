cbp_distribute_mod.f90 : 
                contains the fortran implementation that used mpi,  and most of the LA code.
cbp_parallel,cbp_wrap.cpp,gemm.cpp,gemm_interfaces.cpp : 
                contain the intranode implementation of the matmul.
cpugemms: 
     cpu routines to split code also to cpu (never used in practice).
misc module 
    is empty. In future it will contain some routines from cbp_distribute_mod
